# ![IceandFire's Cataclysm](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IceandFire04/gardendless-cataclysm/refs/heads/main/header.png)

A patch for [PvZ2: Gardendless](https://pvzge.com/en/) that aims to make the game harder and make every plant and zombie distinct. Currently supports Gardendless **0.3.X**.

## Why did I make this?
The main reason I made this was to explore what's possible with the limitedness of gePatcher in it's somewhat primal form. While you can't do much on the surface, you can single-handedly control
the entire balance of the game even just by changing stuff around with the plants (or zombies) only. I've tried modding real PvZ2 for a few years own my own unfinished personal projects. As soon
as I found out Gardendless had modding support, I knew it was going to be good. No dealing with RSBs, RTONs, or other proprietary PopCap formats has made this whole experience fun and kept me interested
longer than any other PvZ project I've tried doing. I always knew Gardendless had insane mod potential, and it looks like it's getting closer to being on par with vanilla's mods.

## The Future
I don't know when I'll finish this patch, and I likely never will. However, it is clear gePatcher will be supported as an official
modding tool for a while, so my eventual plans include covering **every world** in Gardendless and more. There will be a custom Kongfu World and Sky City, as well as completely new ones.

## Betas
The actual repository holds the latest version I'm happy with enough to upload. If you want to play betas, download the source code instead of the release and install it like a release. **Betas will almost always be unfinished and may be a little broken.** However, you should still give them a whirl though if you want!
