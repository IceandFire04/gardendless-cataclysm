# ![IceandFire's Ultra Violence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IceandFire04/gardendless-ultra-violence/refs/heads/main/header.png)

A patch for [PvZ2: Gardendless](https://pvzge.com/en/) that aims to make the game harder and make every plant and zombie unique in their own way. Currently supports Gardendless **0.3.0**.

## Why did I make this?
The main reason I made this was to explore what's possible with the limitedness of gePatcher in it's somewhat primal form. While you can't do much on the surface, you can single-handedly control
the entire balance of the game even just by changing stuff around with the plants (or zombies) only.

I also wanted to _show_ what is possible with Gardendless. I've always looked at this game as one with insane potential for modding (and even just playing the base game in general) and now
is the time to prove that even the most basic of things can let creativity flourish.

Feel free to copy all the code from the patch if you want to try to make your own. Been there, done that!

## The Future
While the patch isn't complete yet, this repo will be updated more when I feel like releasing a "beta" version, most likely when AE is complete. It is clear gePatcher will be supported as an official
modding tool for a while, so I plan on covering **every world** in Gardendless, and also having some custom levels (as replacements for unfun ones) that can net you premium plants for free and a small Kong-Fu World to get those plants. 

I will preface here, **pull requests will most likely not get merged**. Unless it's a _really_ good custom level or something, don't count on me adding it. Also, don't spam issues. If there are bugs with the patch and not Gardendless itself,
then yes, open one. But if you can't beat a level or want to suggest balance changes, use the discussion.

## Nightly
The `nightly` branch is where I just host indev versions of the patch. This branch exists so when I finish an update I can just push to `main` super easily Feel free to try it out though!
